<h2>Call for papers</h2>
<p>Papers (of 20 minutes) addressing and/or meeting any of the potential challenges facing music as an academic subject within higher education are welcome. Although this conference is a response to policy shifts within the United Kingdom, we would like to receive submissions from our international colleagues; in particular, we hope to be in a position to share examples of how music has thrived or suffered within other higher education systems and any exemplary practices that have developed as a response.
